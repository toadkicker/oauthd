# OAuth daemon

The Oauth Daemon is the open source version of the [OAuth.io](https://oauth.io) core. This is a background api server that runs on your own server that allow your clients to authenticate to any 70+ available OAuth provider.

## Prerequisites

- A working redis database >= v2.4, check [Redis quickstart](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart) for a properly installation
- nodejs >= v0.8.2
- npm >= v1.1
- needed packages for npm dependencies: python curl bash

## Installation

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Run the redis server if it's not running yet.

	(sudo) npm install -g forever oauthd
	oauthd config
	oauthd start

You can use `oauthd [start|stop|status|startsync|config]` to manage your daemon.

## Development installation

    (sudo) npm install -g coffee-script grunt-cli forever
    git clone git://github.com/oauth-io/oauthd.git

In the cloned project dir, issue:

    npm install

`npm` will install dependencies listed in `package.json` and compile coffee files.

If you have a problem during `npm install` you may want to restart the compilation step by doing:

	grunt

To start or stop oauthd, just use
`npm [start|stop]` in the oauthd folder.

If you want to start oauthd in debug mode, you can also use `grunt server`

This will launch nodemon and watch/recompile modified files.


## Using OAuth daemon

You may configure config.js in oauthd folder, to configure your ports, connection with redis, enable ssl etc.
You can also write a config.local.js file that will overwrite existing fields of config.js.

By default, you can access it by [http://localhost:6284/admin](http://localhost:6284/admin).

![OAuthd signin](https://oauth.io/img/oauthd-signin.png "OAuthd")

Then the admin interface is available to your url / port set into config.js, at /admin.

The first time you connect, the given login & pass will be registered as the admin user. If you lose it, you can reset the login with `node ./tools/login_reset.js` in the oauthd folder.

Then you can include the generated js sdk from oauthd to use it on your sites. By example for a local test:
`<script src="http://localhost:6284/download/latest/oauth.js"></script>`
